# Bootstrap API Docs

This little library enables you to create sexy API documentation using a very simple `XML` syntax and **Twitter's** incredible [Bootstrap library](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

## Getting Started

  - [Download the library](https://github.com/soapbox-io/bootstrap-api/zipball/master) or clone the repository
  - Copy the contents to your webserver
  - Open up `parser.php` in your browser
    - The page will render the output of the default `config.xml` file
  - Review the simple `config.xml` file for instructions on how to structure your API

## Exporting

  - You can export your API as a ZIP file by simple removing the `preview = "true"` attribute in the beginning the `config.xml` file. Running `parser.php` after this will prompt your browser to download a ZIP file containing everything you need to deploy.
