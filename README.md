# Bootstrap API Docs

This little library enables you to create sexy API documentation using a very simple `XML` syntax and **Twitter's** incredible [Bootstrap library](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

## Getting Started

  - [Download the library](https://github.com/soapbox-io/bootstrap-api/zipball/master) or clone the repository
  - Copy the contents to your webserver
  - Open up `index.php` in your browser
    - The page will render the output of the default `config.xml` file
  - Review the simple `config.xml` file for instructions on how to structure your API

## Exporting

  - You can export your API as a ZIP file by simple removing the `preview = "true"` attribute in the beginning the `config.xml` file. Running `index.php` after this will prompt your browser to download a ZIP file containing everything you need to deploy.

## Problems

### Mac OSX Archive Utility "Operation not permitted"

Unfortunately, as of the current version, we have not found a way to work around this problem on Max OSX Snow Leopard & Lion. To extract the zip file generated by this library, please use another archive decompression utility.

Here is a list of recommended applications:

  - [The Unarchiver (free)](http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html)
  - [Entropy ($19)](http://www.entropyapp.com/)
  - [WinZip Mac ($29.95)](http://www.winzip.com/mac/en/index.htm)
  - [StuffIt ($29.99)](http://www.stuffit.com/)
